# Color

<Description>
  Understanding the color system and its application in your theme.
</Description>

## Color scales

There is a number of 12 step color scales available, each with their own light, dark and alpha variants.

Colors are grouped into 2 categories: accents and grays, and can be specified on your [Theme](/themes/docs/components/theme), or per component where appropriate.

### Accents

The accent is the most dominant color in your theme, it is used for primary buttons, links and other interactive elements. There is a number of accent colors [to choose from](/themes/docs/theme/color#choosing-an-accent-color).

<ThemesColorScale type="accent" />

### Grays

Grays are used for backgrounds, borders, text and other non-interactive elements. You can [choose](/themes/docs/theme/color#choosing-a-gray-color) a pure gray or one of the tinted grays.

<ThemesColorScale type="gray" />

### Alpha variants

Every color has an alpha variant which is designed to appear visually the same when placed over the page background. This is very powerful and allows colors to be overlayed almost without any loss of saturation or hue.

Alpha variants are used automatically within components so no configuration is required. However, if you’d like to use them manually in your own styles you can do so by using [Tokens](/themes/docs/theme/token-reference).

## Choosing an accent color

There is a number of accents to choose from. Visit the [Playground](/themes/playground) page to explore how each accent color looks.

## Choosing a gray color

You can choose a pure gray or a tinted gray scale:

<ThemeGraySwatches />

- `gray` is pure gray
- `mauve` is based on a purple hue
- `slate` is based on a blue hue
- `sage` is based on a green hue
- `olive` is based on a lime hue
- `sand` is based on a yellow hue

### Neutral and natural pairing

The theme will automatically pair your chosen accent with a gray that is designed to compliment it](/colors/docs/palette-composition/composing-a-palette#natural-pairing). You can specify an alternative if you’d prefer a different look.

The difference may seem subtle, but it is impactful on pages with a lot of text or in dense UIs.

You may want to experiment with these settings in your applications and websites to find what works for you.

## Using color tokens

All color values are available as CSS [tokens](/themes/docs/theme/token-reference) should you need to build custom components.

See the [token reference](/themes/docs/theme/token-reference) page for a complete list.

### Aliasing colors

You may find that certain shades that have less common names pair better with your main accent color. For example, it is common to use `crimson` or `ruby` in place of `red`, or `teal`, `jade`, or `grass` in place of `green`.

To reclaim the more intuitive color names like `red`, `green`, or `blue`, you can re-map Radix Themes tokens in place of one another:

```css
/* Your styles.css */
.radix-themes {
  --red-1: var(--ruby-1);
  --red-2: var(--ruby-2);
  --red-3: var(--ruby-3);
  --red-4: var(--ruby-4);
  --red-5: var(--ruby-5);
  --red-6: var(--ruby-6);
  --red-7: var(--ruby-7);
  --red-8: var(--ruby-8);
  --red-9: var(--ruby-9);
  --red-10: var(--ruby-10);
  --red-11: var(--ruby-11);
  --red-12: var(--ruby-12);
  --red-a1: var(--ruby-a1);
  --red-a2: var(--ruby-a2);
  --red-a3: var(--ruby-a3);
  --red-a4: var(--ruby-a4);
  --red-a5: var(--ruby-a5);
  --red-a6: var(--ruby-a6);
  --red-a7: var(--ruby-a7);
  --red-a8: var(--ruby-a8);
  --red-a9: var(--ruby-a9);
  --red-a10: var(--ruby-a10);
  --red-a11: var(--ruby-a11);
  --red-a12: var(--ruby-a12);
}
```

In this example, using the `red` color in Radix Themes components and tokens would now reference the original `ruby` scale.

This is also how Radix Themes re-maps tinted grays like `mauve`, `slate`, `sage`, etc. to `gray` according to your theme setting, so that `gray` always refers to the shade you picked.
